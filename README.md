### The REPORT
#### Findings
- Super Store is giving a lot of discounts on Binders, despite it already being one of their top selling products in all the customer segments across all regions.
- Super Store is spending too much of their discount budget on their stores in Central region. Stores especially in Southern region are comparatively lacking in discounts.
- Only one product was sold in 50.65% of the total orders. 
- Delivery duration in Central region is comparatively slow. Average delivery in Central region takes 0.21 days more for Home Office consumers than overall delivery duration average for the same. 

#### Suggestions
- Discounts should be reduced from Binders (Sub-category) or Office supplies (Category) in general, as they have decent enough sales. Discount budget should be disbursed to the stores in Southern region for sales spree to attract customer attention. 
- In case of their online stores, investment shall be made on machine learning techniques so that people buying only one product from a category shall be recommended with other related products from that same category. 
- In case of offline stores, Super Store shall invest in Planograms (Product Display). More information about how planograms leading to improved sales can be found in the referred link.
- Delivery duration should be reduced in the stores in Central region by introducing ship mode upgrades wherever it's possible. Decreased delivery duration may lead to increase in sales.
